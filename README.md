# College Clutter
## Description 
This is our capstone project for CSCE361. We were tasked with developing a an ecommerce website with the following validations: users will be able to login, create an account, and have their information saved for future uses. The user will be able to view all of the products offered by the online store and add items to a cart. From their cart, users will be able to checkout and have their information (address, card number, name) saved to make the checkout process faster. To view the items, there will be a search function that users can apply a filter to. The backend will take care of the dataprocessing and share informwtion with the front end in a safe and secure way. 

The following information about the items will be provided: The items price, item manufacturer, item description, item rating, 

The following information about sales will be provided: when the sale is taking place and the percentage of the sale. 

## Application Functionality
College Clutter is an online platform designed for college students to find affordable, upcycled, and thrifted clothing items. With busy schedules and tight budgets, many students struggle to find trendy, sustainable fashion options. College Clutter makes it easy by bringing the thrift store experience online, allowing students to browse and shop from their laptops—whether they're in class, on a study break, or relaxing at home. Our goal is to provide stylish, budget-friendly pieces that fit perfectly into any student’s wardrobe while promoting sustainability and convenience.
